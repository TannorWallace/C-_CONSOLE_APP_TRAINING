classes allow us to separate our code in to objects 

methods contain the actual executable code of the object

dotnet restore needs to ne run every time we change rhe dependecies or before the first time the program runs

in else conditions the ELSE statement only runs when the IF is false 

ex.

if (ready)
{
  DoIfTrue();
  //will run when the IF is true
}
else
{
  DoIfFalse();
  //Will Run when the IF is false.
}
